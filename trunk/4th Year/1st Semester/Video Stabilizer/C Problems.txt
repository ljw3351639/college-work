I faced these problems in running this code,

foreach problem, add the #include in the same file of problem

error1: can't find back_inserter item ==> 
sol1: #include <iterator> 

error2: can't find va_start || va_end ==> sol2: #include <stdarg.h>

If you couldn't find the error position, I remember that I found them, so just copy (.c) files from the included folder, and overwrite them on your project.
