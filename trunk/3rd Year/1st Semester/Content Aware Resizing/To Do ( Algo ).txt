			To Do in Algo Project					24 ( 9 done )


10. Why not to change the Calculate_Energy function in ImageOperations
	to retreive the Energy Summed by the minimum of every cell child, also with the direction matrix
	and for the Forward, make your own.
14. Construct a new design for your code,
	for example :
		file for Vertical
		file for Horizontal
		file for Combination between them
18. Design your code, to be faster than Zoom.
4. Increase Size
16. make a scroll bar for slowing the resizing operation
5. Delete Object
17. to know what u choosed or already calculated, make 6 colors, for each choice,
	if already calculated mark it with a new colour like ( Color.Lightblue ), 6 booleans
15. update change in width and height during the resizing operation ( current W & H ).
	+ update time ( every seam )
	+ update energy ( every seam )
6. Change Interface
12. You have a lot of conditions in Forward Energy ( Vertical & Horizontal ),
	try to Simplify the code a little.
20. if entered a new width and height >>
	check the new width and new Height
	if smaller >>> continue deleting fromt the image with sum of the previous images with the rest columns & rows
	if larger >> start a new operation
21. Don't Delete any seam from the image, just shift and work with the new width and height
	here you would like to send the Used Width and height with the deleting function
22. REMEMBER to check for the Overflow Condition in Project Options
     Try making all Int64, Or maybe only the summed Matrix
23. To avoid Copying the array with the lastColoumn ( Seam -> Shifted )
	Use CopyTo to copy the whole coloums( 1D arrays ) in the new matrix >> withou the last
24. Rotating & Flipping && Croping && Protectin && Masks ( R, G, B )










			########################
1. (#Done#) Horizontal Forward Energy
2. (#Done#)Combination between Vertical & Horizontal Forward
3. (#Done#)Progress bar
7. (#Done#)Make a Pix for every variation of input
   ex: ForwardDP,BackwardDP,ForwardGreedy...
   for every input ( Picture and Dimensions )
8. (#Done#)Mypoint[,] dir = new Mypoint[Height,Width];
	why not to make it int
	in Vertical >>> every cell with index i,j will hold a next position i-1,NewJ
	in Horizontal >>> every cell with index i,j will hold a next position NewI,j-1
9. (#Done#)Test Some Pictures to show Dr.Ahmad Salah
13. (#Done#)Don't forget to delete Useless images in your project.
11. (#Will Not Do#, cause of time)In Vertical & Horizontal Seam Deleting, you shouldn't write the code twice,
	you can get the Transpose( T ) of the Horizonal and solve it Vertically
	then get the Transpose again.
	
	but instead i will do the function that gets the transpose and it's reverse.
19. (#Done#)Mention that when u show another image when content aware resizing the PROGRESS BAR
			be INVISIABLE & STILL INVISIABLE
